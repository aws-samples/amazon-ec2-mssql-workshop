In this section you will learn how to launch Amazon FSx to be part of AWS Directory Service domain, configure your workstation to remotely send commands to the servers using Cloudformation or AWS Console.

**It's recommended not to use the CloudFormation script, you will learn more from doing and configure everything by yourself.**

{{% notice tip %}}
If you are using account from EventEngine, the account already have the Cloudformation deployed, it's still recommended reviewing the steps, but you don't need to launch the cloudformation template again or create the resources manually. Continue to **[Step1.4](/lab-1-prerequisites/automations-management.html#aws-tools-for-powershell)**
